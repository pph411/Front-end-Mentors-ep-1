## My process

### Built with

- A try of semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As i'm still learning basics i'm lookin to get all done with the less lines i could.

```html
<picture>
  <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr image" />
</picture>
```

```css
.card {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

To begin i want to center a div at the first try, i want to get better and learn frameworks to build my own ideas that at the moment i dont even imagine how to start with.

### Useful resources

- I only based by the images and style guide.
